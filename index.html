                Denise Stark lives in the Denver area with her son, husband, and her 
                Great Pyrenees mix.  Having earned a college degree in Earth Sciences 
                at the University of Northern Colorado, she ultimately branched out and 
                built a career in the banking industry before departing from that career 
                5 years ago to dedicate more time to raising her son and buying groceries 
                for her husband.  With a desire to exercise her mental faculties, the 
                analytical problem solving challenges of software development make it an 
                ideal place for her to etch out a new career.
                <br>
                <br>
                Denise will graduate from Denver University's first all-woman coding bootcamp 
                in the Spring of 2019 and hit the ground running in Denver's amazing tech-centric 
                landscape.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a well-rounded individual, she is also an enthusiastic cyclist and snowboarder
                while also being a strong proponent of biker safety laws, loves the mountains, 
                and enjoys taking her dog for walks.
